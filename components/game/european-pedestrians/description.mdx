# European Pedestrian Crossings

Learn to recognize countries based on the amount of stripes on their pedestrian crossings. There are quite a few combinations and variations, so this is a great way to commit them to memory.

A lot of the data comes from [GeoHints](https://geohints.com/meta/signs/pedestrian), a great resource for learning about road signs and more.
