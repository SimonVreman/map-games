City Cover challenges you to fill the map by guessing cities around the world. Each correct guess creates a horizontal band across the map at the guessed city's latitude, with some margin to account for nearby areas. Your goal is to guess cities to cover as much of the map as possible.

Only cities with a population of at least 100,000 are valid guesses, so think carefully and use your knowledge of geography to maximize your coverage. How many cities can you name, and how much of the map can you conquer?
