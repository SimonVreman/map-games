# Simple & fun map games

A collection of map-based games, to which I (plan) to add new ones occasionally. Have a cool idea? Reach out via [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/simonvreman.nl)!.

## Games

- [City Cover](/city-cover) - Fill the map by guessing cities around the world. Each correct guess creates a horizontal band across the map at the guessed city's latitude, with some margin to account for nearby areas. Your goal is to guess cities to cover as much of the map as possible.
- [City Blocks](/city-blocks) - Fill the map by guessing cities around the world. Each city is in a block, which size depends on the difficulty. Your goal is to guess cities to cover as much of the map as possible.
