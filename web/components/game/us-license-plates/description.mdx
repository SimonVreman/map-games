Many of the United States license plates have a unique design that is often recognizable even when blurred. This game helps you memorize the different designs and recognize them through the blurred images. Knowing these by heart is key for being good at US region guessing.

For each state, the most recent passenger plate design is used. There are also other common designs, or previous designs still in use, but these are not (yet) included in the game.
