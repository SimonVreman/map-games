A simple streak-based game to memorize which United States telephone code corresponds to which locations. Ideal for those who want to gain an edge in US region guessing.

The United States, just like Canada is part of the North American Numbering Plan, which has an extensive system of geographically determined area codes. On the surface level, there is not a clear pattern to these codes, so you will likely have to memorize a significant amount of them. Each geographic region has at least one code, but can have more codes due to the practice of overlaying codes. Read more about this system on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan).
