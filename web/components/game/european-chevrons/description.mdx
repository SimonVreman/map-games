A simple streak-based game to memorize which countries use the different variations of chevron road sign colors in Europe. They are quite varied in certain regions, making them useful to differentiate these countries.

The game is based on a [similar looking map](https://www.reddit.com/r/geoguessr/comments/lwa9wr/map_of_european_road_curve_chevron_signs/) posted on Reddit by u/isaacSW.
