City Blocks challenges you to fill the map by guessing cities around the world, similar to [City Cover](/city-cover). Each city is in a block, which size depends on the difficulty. Your goal is to guess cities to cover as much of the map as possible.

Only cities with a population of at least 100,000 are valid guesses, so think carefully and use your knowledge of geography to maximize your coverage. How many cities can you name, and how much of the map can you conquer?
